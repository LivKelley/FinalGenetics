# GeneFinder
Nitrogene is a program that defines genetic percentage matches with the gene for nitrogenase using memoized levenstein distances and a code that converts a sequence of base pairs into three-base pair codons.

After downloading this program, run this function by choosing a bacterial colony and use the program Finch to find its base pair sequence. Put this sequence into a script format and input it into the function's variable (dna). The program should output an image displaying the strength of the percentage match by the length of the bolded sections of a bar representing the DNA. This program should work with multiple genome inputs, so long as each sequence is in its own string and then put into a list.
